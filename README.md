## Step 1: Download Ollama
For this, just go to ollama page (https://ollama.com), click the download button and follow the instructions.  
## Step 2: Load the model of your choice
For this, check out the available models on their site (https://ollama.com/library)  
Once you land on the cli of Ollama, type:  
ollama run your_favorite_model  
This will download the model you want to use (it may take time as we are on a few Go for the model).  
## Step 3: Create your python project  
For the model, you just need the openai module, for the speaking interface, you'll need playsound and gtts.
